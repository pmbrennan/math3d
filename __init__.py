"""
A simple and easy to use 3d math library.

This module contains reference implementations for :

Vector (variable-length) 
Matrix (variable-dimension)
Quaternion

with appropriate unit tests to ensure correct implementation.

The focus of this project is to provide a reference implementation
of some useful mathematical objects. The goals are:

- Clarity
- Correctness
- Test Coverage

These routines are not intended to replace good, high-performance tools like
NumPy or SciPi, but instead to demonstrate how these objects are supposed to
work and to provide a point of reference. Particularly, these routines have not
been optimized for performance, either in memory or in time. I wrote these
routines to supplement my own understanding of the math demonstrated here, and I
am releasing it as open source to encourage others to achieve the same (or
hopefully greater!) level of understanding.
